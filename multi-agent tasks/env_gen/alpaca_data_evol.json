        "instruction": "**Task:**  \n- Work together to build a functional watchtower at coordinates [0, 0, 12]. The tower must be 10 blocks tall with a 3x3 base and a ladder leading to the top.  \n- One agent should gather wood from nearby trees (within the allowed coordinates) to craft ladders and planks, while another agent mines cobblestone from the ground for the tower's foundation.  \n- Place a chest at the top of the tower containing 5 arrows and a bow for defense.  \n- Ensure all leftover materials are stored in the chest upon completion.  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n- The tower must be sturdy (no gaps in the structure).  \n- The ladder must be accessible from the ground.  \n- All materials must be sourced within the allowed coordinate range."
