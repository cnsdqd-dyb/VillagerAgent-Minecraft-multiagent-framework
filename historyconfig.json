The interior features a furnace, crafting tables, and storage chests. The surrounding area includes wheat fields to the west (around [-5, 0, 15]) and a riverbank to the east (near [3, 0, 5]) where sugar cane grows. The bakery has a wooden door at [1, 0, 10] and is illuminated by torches to prevent hostile mob spawns.  \n\n**Interactive-Items:**  \n- **Furnace**: [0, 1, 10] (facing north)  \n- **Chest (Storage)**: [2, 0, 10]  \n- **Lever**: To be placed at [1, 0, 10] (for locking the bakery)  \n\n**Task:**  \n- Collaborate to construct and operate a bakery at [0, 0, 10].  \n- One agent must gather wheat from the nearby fields (located around [-5, 0, 15]) and craft it into bread using the furnace placed inside the bakery.  \n- Another agent should collect sugar cane from the riverbank (near [3, 0, 5]) and craft it into sugar, then use it to bake cakes in the furnace.  \n- A third agent must manage the storage, ensuring all baked goods (bread and cakes) are placed in the chest at [2, 0, 10] and that the furnace is always stocked with fuel (coal or wood).  \n- The bakery must operate for a full Minecraft day (from sunrise to sunset). Once complete, all agents must lock the bakery by placing a lever next to the door at [1, 0, 10] and switching it off.  \n- Ensure no hostile mobs enter the bakery by lighting the area with torches and eliminating any threats.  \n\n**Actions available:**  \n- Agents can harvest wheat and sugar cane from designated areas.  \n- Agents can use the furnace to bake bread and cakes.  \n- Agents can transfer items to and from the storage chest.  \n- Agents can place and toggle the lever to lock the bakery.  \n- Agents must maintain torch lighting and defend against hostile mobs.  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The bakeryâ€™s operation time is tied to the Minecraft day-night cycle.  \n- Hostile mobs may spawn in unlit areas, so agents should prioritize lighting and security.  \n- All baked goods must be stored before locking the bakery."

The ground floor at [0, 0, 10] is near the village square, while the observation deck at [0, 12, 10] overlooks the entire settlement.  \n- The nearby cave at [-5, 3, 15] contains redstone deposits but is dimly lit, so bring torches. The village blacksmith at [8, 0, 18] has a furnace and anvil, along with iron ingots stored in a chest.  \n- The storage shed at [3, 0, 5] is made of oak planks and cobblestone, housing stone slabs and additional oak planks. A crafting table is available inside.  \n- The observation deck is constructed from quartz and glass panes, with a chest containing fireworks at [0, 12, 8].  \n\n**Task:**  \n- Work together to construct and activate a redstone-powered elevator between the ground floor at [0, 0, 10] and the observation deck at [0, 12, 10].  \n- One agent must gather redstone dust from the nearby cave at [-5, 3, 15] and craft pistons using iron ingots from the village blacksmith at [8, 0, 18].  \n- Another agent should collect building materials (stone slabs and oak planks) from the storage shed at [3, 0, 5] and construct the elevator shaft.  \n- A third agent must wire the redstone circuitry correctly to ensure the elevator functions smoothly (test by sending a villager up and down).  \n- The elevator must be completed before sunset (set time to 12000 for a time check).  \n- All agents must meet at the observation deck to celebrate once the elevator is operational (set off fireworks stored in the chest at [0, 12, 8]).  \n\n**Actions available:**  \n- Agents can mine redstone from the cave and craft pistons at the blacksmith.  \n- Agents can gather building materials from the storage shed and construct the elevator shaft.  \n- Agents can wire redstone circuits and test the elevator with a villager.  \n- Agents can use the crafting table in the storage shed or blacksmith for necessary items.  \n- Agents must monitor the time to ensure completion before sunset.  \n- Agents can set off fireworks from the observation deck chest upon successful completion."

The chest at [-5, 0, 15] is placed under a wooden shelter made of oak planks and contains cobblestone and oak logs. The forest at [3, 0, 18] has abundant oak and birch trees for wood gathering.  \n- Two beds are placed inside a small wooden hut near the construction site at [1, 0, 20] and [-1, 0, 20], equipped with basic furnishings like crafting tables and furnaces.  \n\n**Task:**  \n- Work together to construct a watchtower at [0, 10, 20] with a height of at least 10 blocks.  \n- Gather building materials (cobblestone and wood) from the chest at [-5, 0, 15] and the nearby forest at [3, 0, 18].  \n- One agent must remain at the top of the tower to monitor the surroundings while the others gather materials and build.  \n- Place a torch every 3 blocks on the tower to ensure visibility at night.  \n- All agents must sleep in the beds at [1, 0, 20] and [-1, 0, 20] by midnight to avoid mobs.  \n\n**Actions available:**  \n- Agents can chop trees in the forest for wood.  \n- Agents can retrieve cobblestone and other materials from the chest.  \n- Agents can build the tower layer by layer, ensuring structural stability.  \n- The monitoring agent can alert others of any approaching threats.  \n- Agents must place torches strategically to prevent mob spawns.  \n- All agents must return to the beds before midnight to reset their spawn points and avoid nighttime dangers.  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The tower should have a ladder or staircase for easy access.  \n- A crafting table is available near the beds for any necessary tool repairs or crafting.  \n- The river nearby can be used as a water source if needed.  \n\nThis task requires division of labor (material gathering, construction, and monitoring) and coordination to ensure the tower is built safely and efficiently."

The storage chest at [-3, 1, 20] is located under a wooden awning made of spruce planks and fences. Nearby, a crafting table and a furnace are available for use.  \n- The coordinates for the farm (x = [-5, 5], y = [1, 3], z = [5, 15]) are marked by stone boundary markers at each corner.  \n\n**Interactive-Items:**  \n- **Storage Chest**: [-3, 1, 20] (contains wood, redstone, hoppers, seeds, and basic tools)  \n- **Crafting Table**: [-2, 1, 20]  \n- **Furnace**: [-1, 1, 20] (facing south)  \n\n**Task:**  \n- Work together to construct and activate a redstone-powered automatic wheat farm within the designated area.  \n- Gather materials (wood, redstone, hoppers, and seeds) from the storage chest at [-3, 1, 20].  \n- Build a 5x5 tilled farmland plot centered at [0, 1, 10] and plant wheat seeds.  \n- Design and connect a redstone mechanism using dispensers and water buckets to automate harvesting.  \n- Ensure the harvested wheat is collected in a chest placed at [2, 1, 12] and test the system by growing and harvesting at least 3 batches of wheat.  \n\n**Actions available:**  \n- Agents can use the crafting table and furnace to prepare materials.  \n- Agents must collaborate on redstone wiring, with at least two agents working together for complex connections.  \n- Agents can till soil, plant seeds, and activate the redstone mechanism.  \n- Agents must ensure all materials are sourced only from the provided chest.  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n- The farm must fit within the coordinates: x = [-5, 5], y = [1, 3], z = [5, 15].  \n- All materials must be sourced only from the provided chest.  \n- The system must be tested with at least 3 successful harvests."
