    "task_goal": "- Collaborate to build a small, sustainable farm within the given coordinates. The farm should include a 5x5 plot of farmland, a water source, and a storage chest for harvested crops.\n\n- **Agent 1 (Farmer):**\n  - Dig a 5x5 area at [5, 0, 15] and till the soil to create farmland.\n  - Place a water source block in the center of the farmland at [7, 0, 15].\n  - Plant wheat seeds in the tilled soil. The seeds can be found in the chest at [5, 0, 18].\n\n- **Agent 2 (Harvester):**\n  - Once the wheat has grown, harvest it and place the harvested wheat in the chest at [5, 0, 16].\n  - Replant the harvested wheat seeds to ensure continuous growth.\n\n- **Agent 3 (Supplier):**\n  - Collect water from the nearby river at [8, 0, 20] using empty buckets from the chest at [5, 0, 18].\n  - Ensure the water source block in the center of the farmland is always full.\n  - If the water source dries up, refill it with the collected water.\n\n- **Agent 4 (Guard):**\n  - Patrol the perimeter of the farm to protect it from any hostile mobs that might try to destroy the crops.\n  - Use the provided wooden sword from the chest at [5, 0, 18] to defend the farm.\n\n- **Additional Instructions:**\n  - All agents must coordinate their actions to ensure the farm is continuously productive.\n  - Return all unused materials and tools to the chest at [5, 0, 18] after each task is completed.\n  - The farm should be maintained for at least 3 Minecraft days to ensure its sustainability.",
