The storage chest at [-3, 1, 20] is located under a wooden awning made of spruce planks and fences. Nearby, a crafting table and a furnace are available for use.  \n- The coordinates for the farm (x = [-5, 5], y = [1, 3], z = [5, 15]) are marked by stone boundary markers at each corner.  \n\n**Interactive-Items:**  \n- **Storage Chest**: [-3, 1, 20] (contains wood, redstone, hoppers, seeds, and basic tools)  \n- **Crafting Table**: [-2, 1, 20]  \n- **Furnace**: [-1, 1, 20] (facing south)  \n\n**Task:**  \n- Work together to construct and activate a redstone-powered automatic wheat farm within the designated area.  \n- Gather materials (wood, redstone, hoppers, and seeds) from the storage chest at [-3, 1, 20].  \n- Build a 5x5 tilled farmland plot centered at [0, 1, 10] and plant wheat seeds.  \n- Design and connect a redstone mechanism using dispensers and water buckets to automate harvesting.  \n- Ensure the harvested wheat is collected in a chest placed at [2, 1, 12] and test the system by growing and harvesting at least 3 batches of wheat.  \n\n**Actions available:**  \n- Agents can use the crafting table and furnace to prepare materials.  \n- Agents must collaborate on redstone wiring, with at least two agents working together for complex connections.  \n- Agents can till soil, plant seeds, and activate the redstone mechanism.  \n- Agents must ensure all materials are sourced only from the provided chest.  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n- The farm must fit within the coordinates: x = [-5, 5], y = [1, 3], z = [5, 15].  \n- All materials must be sourced only from the provided chest.  \n- The system must be tested with at least 3 successful harvests."
